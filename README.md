# Project Name: The Next Web

## Week 2 Solo Project

Coding is an amazing experience & the more time I spent with the code I found myself addicted to not leaving it incomplete.

I was not at all confident about the linters, that was a first-time experience and I successfully managed to clear all errors.

Skills Revived & Learned:

- Versioning & best practices of maintaining branches of safe deployed and local dev
- git flow & Github flow
- HTML, CSS new and better elements, semantics, features etc
- Cloning - the hard work and skills needed to successfully make a clone.
- Linter - install & fix tests {still not managed to get styleint to run on VSC locally}
- Collaborative learning, being patient, helping each other succeed.
- Attending Daily standup, being focused, accountable.

> Learning Goals:

- Creating responsive UI
- Applying front end best practices
- Understanding the usefulness of css propessors
-
